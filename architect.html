      An egghead and philosopher, you don't like too much expressiveness. You always seek calm emotions and comfort. You're very careful when making decisions, preferring to analyze and find connections between the past, present, and future.

       You are very sensitive to changes, and you don't handle them easily. You always try to collect all of your facts, thoughts, and ideas, and that's why you are very often tense.
