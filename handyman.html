      The handyman, as a rule, has a technical mindset and likes to make things by hand. You don't hurry with taking decisions and think that it is better twice measured than once wrong. However, you always meet deadlines and you are very punctual by nature. You perceive this world through feelings, and your opinion of things happening around you is very objective and specific. By nature, you are communicative, but you will refuse communication once you feel insincerity.
